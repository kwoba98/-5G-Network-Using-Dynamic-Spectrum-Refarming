# Implementation of 5G Network Using Dynamic Spectrum Refarming

## Introduction

This project, conducted at Kyambogo University, explores the implementation of a 5G network using dynamic spectrum refarming. Dynamic spectrum refarming is a resource management technique that allows different network technologies (such as 4G and 5G) to operate in the same frequency band, optimizing the use of limited and expensive radio frequency spectrum.

## Problem Statement

The radio frequency spectrum is a limited, scarce, and expensive resource, with most of the existing spectrum already allocated to technologies like 2G, 3G, and 4G. Allocating spectrum for 5G in the mm-wave and higher bands is costly and provides low coverage, despite high capacity. Dynamic spectrum refarming offers a solution to these challenges, allowing for efficient use of existing spectrum resources.

## Objectives

### Main Objective
- To implement and assess the performance of 5G technology using dynamic spectrum refarming.

### Specific Objectives
- Investigate the performance of existing 4G networks.
- Perform dynamic spectrum refarming for 5G.
- Evaluate the impact of dynamic spectrum refarming on the throughput and latency of 5G.

## Justification

Dynamic spectrum allocation enhances spectrum efficiency, optimizes QoS parameters (such as latency, throughput, and reliability), facilitates load balancing, and provides scalability and flexibility in wireless networks.

## Significance

- Improved user experience on the network.
- Enhanced spectrum efficiency.
- Cost-effective use of existing 4G spectrum for 5G technology.
- Increased network coverage.

## Methodology

1. **Investigate 4G Performance**:
   - Overview of 4G technology and LTE architecture.
   - Analysis of multiple access in LTE and MIMO technology.

2. **Dynamic Spectrum Refarming for 5G**:
   - Use the harmony-in-gradation method.
   - Define user classes and network configuration.
   - User association based on location and signal strength.
   - Resource mapping and dynamic resource allocation.

3. **Evaluate Impact**:
   - Measure throughput and latency improvements in 5G compared to 4G.

## Results

- Significant improvements in throughput and latency for 5G using dynamic spectrum refarming.
- 5G network achieved better QoS values for throughput and latency compared to 4G.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

Dynamic spectrum refarming positively impacts 5G technology, increasing throughput up to 250Mbps and reducing latency to 10ms. It is recommended as a cost-effective and quick way to set up new 5G networks while considering standalone 5G for full benefits.
